## Key Brand Facts (verified across site content)
- Chris Traver: 6th generation Montana native, born Bozeman, relocated Helena 2023, 18 years experience
- Four sons mentored in the trade
- Tagline: "Crafting Timeless Beauty One Floor at a Time" — "timeless" RESERVED for tagline only

- Phone: (406) 451-2282
- Estimate CTA: "Get a Free Estimate" or "Call (406) 451-2282" — one per section

## Established Brand Language (do not rephrase these)
- "We see potential where others see problems" — repair/restoration page (used as feature card title)
- "18 Years in Every Board. Helena, Butte & Bozeman." — homepage hero headline
- "From custom trapdoors to seamless stone-to-hardwood transitions, we handle the installations other companies won't touch." — installation intro (keep intact)
- "Chris is an expert in water-based finishes — low odor, quick drying, and environmentally friendly." — sanding page feature card (exact wording locked)
- Sanding page subtitle: "Reveal What's Underneath" — changed from "Revitalize Your Floors" ("revitalize" adjacent to banned "revitalize your investment")

## Montana Geographic References (use these specifically)
- Helena: historic homes in the Gulch / Last Chance Gulch area; many date to 1880s–early 1900s with original fir/pine floors; old-growth wood denser than modern milled stock
- Bozeman: newer construction in subdivisions south of town
- Big Sky: high-end chalets, mountain homes
- Climate: dry winters, wood stoves, forced-air heating, humidity drops to ~20% indoors
- Entryway water damage from snow/mud tracked in during shoulder seasons is a common Montana-specific repair scenario
- Cupping/gapping near wood stoves and radiators is a recurring Montana damage pattern

## Species and Finish Facts (from FAQ, verified)
- White oak and hickory: recommended for Montana climate (hardness, stability)
- Water-based finishes: faster cure, lower odor, better flex with seasonal wood movement — Chris specializes in these
- Optimal indoor humidity: 35–55%
- Acclimation: 48–72 hours minimum — flagged for Chris verification in installation page draft

## Content Patterns — Service Pages
- Front matter features: 4 cards, each with title + 1-2 sentence description
- Features should be concrete and specific, not generic claims
- "With ease" and similar effortlessness phrases undersell craft — avoid
- Generic superlatives in feature cards (e.g., "finest") should be replaced with specifics
- Markdown body below front matter is where geographic/climate/process depth lives
- Use H2 headings, keep scannable, numbered lists for process sequences
- Flag unverified specifics with [CHRIS: verify] before delivering to client
- Repair/restoration page: 3 H2 sections — damage patterns specific to Montana homes, assessment/process sequence, honest scope (what can and can't be saved)
- Repair page timeline: 4–7 days depending on damage extent (vs. 3–5 days for a standard refinish)
- Old-growth fir/pine in Helena historic homes: denser than modern milled stock — important differentiator for restoration work

## Stairs Page — Key Patterns (from localization pass)
- Slab-style treads (thick solid-wood, single pieces, no finger-jointing) is a key differentiator — surfaced from Nextdoor; use in feature card and body copy
- Carpet-to-hardwood conversion: check substructure/stringers first — older homes may need sistering before finish treads
- Apply more finish coats on stairs than floors; satin sheen hides wear better than gloss
- Finish in sections so one side remains passable during cure
- Stair timeline: 3–6 days (refinish on shorter end, full conversion longer)
- Helena: multi-story turn-of-century homes, carpeted original stairs, possible rot/water damage in treads
- Bozeman: builder-grade pine/poplar treads that homeowners want upgraded to match white oak/hickory floors
- Big Sky: open-concept great rooms, slab treads as furniture-grade millwork, clean transitions
- Cabins: reclaimed wood, hand-scraped texture, character finishes

## Bozeman Landing Page — Key Patterns
- File: /workspaces/traver-hardwood-floors/content/bozeman.md
- SEO target: "hardwood flooring bozeman mt" (387 imp) — created to capture Bozeman search demand
- Subtitle used: "Born Here. Working Here. 18 Years of Hardwood Floors." — leads with Chris's Bozeman origin
- Intro front matter leads with Chris's Bozeman roots (born/raised) as primary trust signal for local search
- Body H2 sections: Why Bozeman Homeowners Call Us / Species and Finish Choices for the Gallatin Valley / New Construction Throughout the Gallatin Valley / Big Sky and Mountain Home Work / Serving Bozeman and the Surrounding Area
- Geographic references used: Huffine Lane, Four Corners, Bridger Canyon Road, Gallatin Canyon, Belgrade, Manhattan (MT)
- Key Bozeman-specific angle: builder-grade finishes wearing out in fast-growth subdivisions — common scenario for refinishing calls
- Big Sky section: Nordic/whitened finishes, slab treads as furniture-grade millwork, great room design detail
- Closing CTA: free on-site estimate + phone number (406) 451-2282 — one CTA at end, no stacking

## About Page — Key Patterns
- File: /workspaces/traver-hardwood-floors/layouts/about-us/single.html (HTML template, not Markdown)
- Hero subtitle revised to: "Six generations of Montana roots, 18 years of hardwood floors"
- Section headings: "Meet Chris Traver" / "How He Works" / "A Family Legacy"
- Section 1 (bio): roots Chris in Bozeman origin + Helena relocation — explains WHY Helena (historic housing stock, buried floors waiting to be restored); mentions range of work by scale (200 sq ft to full historic restoration)
- Section 2 (credentials): explains water-based finish choice as a Montana climate response, not a product preference; references national publications; emphasizes honest assessment approach (will recommend replacement if that's the right call)
- Section 3 (family): kept short — the "his name is on it" angle is the trust signal
- Do NOT use "Professional Excellence" as a heading — replaced with "How He Works" (more specific, less generic)
- About page does character/story depth; service pages do technical depth — don't duplicate climate/process detail here
- First person singular ("I") is appropriate on About page per brand guidelines — but current draft uses third person throughout for consistency with rest of site copy; revisit if Chris wants a more personal voice

## Homepage — Key Patterns (from localization pass)
- Hero headline is locked: "18 Years in Every Board. Helena, Butte & Bozeman."
- Hero subheadline references specific geography: "Gulch" for Helena historic homes, "white oak in a new build south of Bozeman"
- "Built for Montana Homes" section: lead with climate reality (dry winters, wood stoves), then species/finish rationale — do not use generic "complement Montana's unique character" phrasing
- "Family-Owned Tradition" section: open with Chris's bio specifics (6th gen, 18 years, Bozeman → Helena), close with sons + name-on-it trust signal — keep short, 2 paragraphs max
- Services section heading changed from "Expert Services" to "What We Do" — more direct, less generic
- Service card one-liners: keep "Reveal the floor hiding under years of wear" (sanding) and "We see potential where others see problems" (repair) locked; installation and stairs updated to be more specific
- Installation card: "Custom patterns, species selection, and transitions other contractors won't attempt."
- Stairs card: "Carpet-to-hardwood conversions, slab treads, and refinishing on every stair style."
- "Our Work" intro: reference specific geographies (Big Sky chalets, historic Helena homes) — not generic
- Testimonials intro: name the cities (Helena, Bozeman, Butte) — not generic "homeowners"
- FAQ section header is on-brand as-is — do not revise
- Homepage is a landing page: tight and punchy, not long-form; Montana localization via specifics, not adjectives
- Meta description pattern: lead with services + cities, then Chris's key credential, end with CTA hook

## Refinishing Landing Page — Key Patterns
- File: /workspaces/traver-hardwood-floors/content/refinishing.md
- SEO targets: "wood floor refinishing near me" / "hardwood floor refinishing helena mt" / "hardwood refinishing bozeman" (125+ combined impressions)
- Differentiated from sanding-and-finishing.md: customer-facing (signs you need it, refinish vs replace, what it costs/involves) not process-focused
- Subtitle: "Your Floors Have More Life in Them" — leads with hope/value rather than process
- 5 H2 sections: Signs Your Floors Need Refinishing / Refinish or Replace / What Refinishing Involves / Finish Options in a Montana Climate / Free Estimates closing with phone
- "Refinish or Replace" section explicitly names Helena Gulch old-growth fir as the case for saving floors — uses the density differentiator
- Sanding page intro line: "a stain that looked good in 2003" — customer-voice, use this style for refinishing-adjacent copy
- Feature card 2 uses cost comparison angle ("A Fraction of Replacement Cost") — first time cost framing used as a feature card; appropriate for this intent
- Closing H2 is "Free Estimates — Helena, Bozeman, Butte, and Beyond" — geo-keywords in heading for SEO
- Timeline maintained at 3–5 days, consistent with sanding page and FAQ

## SEO / Title Tag Constraints
- Title tag template: `{{ .Title }} | Helena & Bozeman, MT | {{ .Site.Title }}` — brand name is 22 chars; realistic display limit is ~70 chars, not strict 60
- Homepage title: "Hardwood Flooring Helena, Bozeman & Butte, MT | Traver Hardwood Floors" (70 chars, acceptable)
- Refinishing seo_title: drop "Near Me" — it doesn't earn its characters when Helena/Bozeman are named
- Sanding page meta description: must stay under 160 chars — approved trim removes "sanding, staining, and" (redundant within a refinishing description)
- Bozeman meta description: prefer "18 years of hardwood floors" over "18 years of expertise" for credential consistency

## Testimonials — Known Issues (homepage _index.md)
- Sarah M. quote contains "unmatched" (banned word)
- Mike T. quote contains exclamation point
- David R. quote contains "Best" (banned word)
- These are customer quotes, not brand copy — Chris's call whether to display as-is or swap for cleaner alternatives
- Pending Chris decision: do not rewrite customer quotes without authorization

## CTA Discipline — Closing Sections
- Refinishing page closing: "Call us at (406) 451-2282 or request an estimate online" is technically two CTAs — flag for Chris to pick one
- Preferred pattern: single action, specific to the page intent (refinishing leads = phone call for estimate)
