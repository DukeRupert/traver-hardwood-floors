intro: "Chris Traver grew up in Bozeman. He knows the Gallatin Valley — the new builds going up south of town, the mountain homes off Bridger Canyon Road, the chalets at Big Sky. Bozeman isn't a market we drive to when it's convenient. It's part of our core service area, and it has been from the start."

## Why Bozeman Homeowners Call Us

Bozeman has grown fast. The new construction south of town — off Huffine Lane, out toward Four Corners, up into the Bridger foothills — has brought a lot of hardwood floors into homes that were built quickly and finished to a price point. Those builder-grade installs look fine on day one. A few years in, the finish wears through in the high-traffic zones, the transitions start to lift, and homeowners who invested in a beautiful house realize the floors don't match what they paid for.

That's one of the most common calls we get from Bozeman. The other is new construction — custom homes and high-end builds where the builder has allocated a real budget for hardwood and needs a craftsman who can execute custom patterns, handle difficult transitions, and work with the architect's vision rather than around it.

We also work regularly up the Gallatin Canyon and at Big Sky, where the design expectations are higher and the conditions are more demanding. At elevation, the humidity swings are wider and the temperature differentials are greater. Wood selection and finish choice matter more in a mountain home than in a valley build.

## Species and Finish Choices for the Gallatin Valley

Montana's dry winters are the main variable in every flooring decision we make here. When forced-air heat pulls indoor humidity down into the 20% range — and in a Bozeman winter that happens regularly — wood contracts. The wrong species or the wrong finish can gap, crack, or peel within a season or two.

White oak is the species we recommend most often for Gallatin Valley homes. It's dense, dimensionally stable, and handles seasonal movement without telegraphing every humidity shift. The open grain takes water-based finishes exceptionally well, and the natural color works with both the warm, earthy palettes common in mountain homes and the cooler, lighter aesthetics that have become popular in newer Bozeman construction.

Hickory is worth considering if you have heavy traffic — it's harder than white oak and holds up to the kind of daily use a busy family puts on a floor. The character is more pronounced: wider variation in color and grain, which some homeowners love and others find too busy. We look at the room, the light, the rest of the finishes in the house, and give you a real recommendation.

For Big Sky and mountain builds specifically, we've done whitened and Nordic-style finishes that open up the floor visually and complement the natural light coming off the snow. These require a specific process and the right substrate — not every wood takes that treatment the same way. We've worked through it enough to know what holds up and what doesn't.

Water-based finishes are our strong recommendation across the board for this climate. They cure faster than oil-based, which matters when you're working in an occupied home or on a tight construction schedule. They flex with the wood through seasonal movement rather than cracking under it. And they dry clear, so the natural character of your white oak or hickory comes through rather than shifting amber under an oil-based topcoat.

## New Construction Throughout the Gallatin Valley

Bozeman's growth has pushed new construction into areas that weren't subdivisions five years ago — out toward Manhattan, up toward Bridger Canyon, and across the valley floor in Belgrade and Four Corners. We work across all of it.

For new construction installs, the prep work is where the project succeeds or fails. Concrete slabs — common in slab-on-grade builds throughout the valley — require moisture testing before any wood goes down. We test every slab and install an appropriate barrier or specify an engineered product rated for direct-to-slab installation when the numbers call for it. Skipping that step is what causes cupping and buckling six months after move-in.

Acclimation matters too. Hardwood delivered to a newly framed home and installed the next day will move after it's down — it hasn't had time to adjust to the temperature and humidity of the interior. We allow a minimum of 48–72 hours of acclimation, and longer during dry winter months when the gap between delivery conditions and your home's interior can be significant.

Custom patterns — herringbone, diagonal, feature borders — require layout planning before the first board goes down. We work through the geometry in advance so the pattern lands correctly at every doorway and focal wall. That planning time is what separates a pattern that looks intentional from one that looks like an afterthought.

## Big Sky and Mountain Home Work

The work we do at Big Sky is different from a valley subdivision install. The design bar is higher, the details are more demanding, and the conditions are more extreme.

Open-concept great rooms with a hardwood floor as the visual anchor of the space require a different level of attention to layout, seam placement, and finish consistency. When the floor runs uninterrupted from the front entry through the living room and into the kitchen, every board placement decision is visible from multiple angles. We plan those rooms carefully.

Slab-style stair treads — thick, solid-wood pieces installed as single units, not finger-jointed buildup — are a common request in the mountain chalets we work in. The tread needs to read as furniture-grade millwork, because in a great room design, it essentially is. We mill, fit, and finish each tread individually.

The Gallatin Canyon corridor from Bozeman to Big Sky gives us a range of project types: ski cabins that want a durable, character-forward reclaimed-wood look; newer chalets with architect-specified species and custom finish requirements; and mid-range vacation homes where the goal is a floor that looks right and holds up through years of rental traffic without needing constant maintenance. We've done all of it.

## Serving Bozeman and the Surrounding Area

We serve Bozeman, the Gallatin Valley, Big Sky, Bridger Canyon, Belgrade, Manhattan, and the surrounding communities as a regular part of our schedule — not as an occasional out-of-town trip. Chris grew up here, and the work in this area is a core part of what Traver Hardwood Floors does.

Every project starts with a free on-site estimate. We look at your subfloor, talk through species and finish options, and give you a specific number based on what's actually involved. Call us at (406) 451-2282 to get started.
