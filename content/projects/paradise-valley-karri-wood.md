This stunning Paradise Valley home features reclaimed Karri wood flooring with a rich history. Karri is a magnificent hardwood native to Western Australia, prized for its exceptional durability and beautiful grain patterns.

## About Karri Wood

Reclaimed Karri wood is typically salvaged from old agricultural buildings in Australia—barns, shearing sheds, and industrial structures that have stood for generations. This gives each plank a story and a character that simply can't be replicated with new materials.

## The Restoration

When we first saw these floors, they had lost their luster after years of wear. Our job was to carefully resand the reclaimed Karri wood and bring it back to life, revealing the deep, rich tones and distinctive grain that make this wood so special.

The result speaks for itself—floors that honor their Australian heritage while perfectly complementing this beautiful Montana home.
