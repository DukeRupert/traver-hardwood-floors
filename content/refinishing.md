## Signs Your Hardwood Floors Need Refinishing

Not every worn floor needs a full sand-and-refinish. Here's how to tell when refinishing is the right call.

**The finish is gone in high-traffic areas.** When you can see bare wood — or the floor feels rough underfoot in paths between rooms — the finish has been worn through and the wood itself is vulnerable. Water from mopping, spills, and everyday moisture can penetrate unprotected wood and cause staining or swelling.

**Deep scratches that don't buff out.** Surface scratches that stay in the finish layer can sometimes be addressed with a buff-and-recoat — a lighter process that adds new finish over the existing surface. But when scratches reach the wood itself, a full sand-down is what it takes to get a clean result.

**Discoloration or old stain you're tired of.** If a previous owner chose a stain that doesn't suit your home, refinishing is the way to change it. We sand back to bare wood and start fresh with whatever color and sheen fits the room.

**Gray, black, or uneven patches.** Graying on the surface is usually oxidized finish and can be sanded out. Dark or black staining that has penetrated the wood fiber is more serious — it may require board replacement in those areas. We'll assess the extent during the estimate.

**Dull, flat finish that cleaning doesn't fix.** If your floors look dull even right after mopping, the finish may be past the point where a simple clean helps. This is often the first sign that refinishing is worth considering.

## Refinish or Replace — How We Think About It

The honest answer most of the time: refinish.

Hardwood floors are thick enough to be sanded and refinished multiple times over their life. A standard hardwood board has enough material to be sanded four to seven times before it reaches the tongue and groove. Unless your floors have structural damage, moisture problems that have reached the subfloor, or boards that are too thin to sand again, replacement is rarely necessary.

We see a lot of floors in Helena's historic homes — particularly in the Gulch and the neighborhoods surrounding Last Chance Gulch — where original fir and pine have survived a century of hard use. Sanded down and properly finished, those floors can look extraordinary. The wood is old-growth in many cases, denser than anything milled today. Covering it with new flooring is the wrong call.

That said, there are real situations where replacement makes more sense:

- The floor has been sanded so many times it's reached the tongue. At that point, there's no room left for another round.
- Widespread moisture damage has warped or separated boards throughout the room, not just in isolated spots.
- The existing wood species or width doesn't match what you're building toward — for example, you're adding hardwood to adjacent rooms and want a single consistent floor throughout.

We'll tell you which situation you're in during the estimate. If replacement is the better path, we'll say so.

## What Refinishing Involves

A standard refinishing project runs 3–5 days from start to finish. Here's the basic sequence:

1. **On-site estimate.** We look at the condition of your floors, check for soft spots or subfloor issues, and talk through what you want the result to look like. This is where we'll tell you whether a full sand-and-refinish is needed or whether a lighter buff-and-recoat will do the job.

2. **Prep.** We cover doorways and HVAC vents to contain dust. Clear the room of furniture before we arrive — and take down anything hanging on nearby walls, since sanding vibration travels.

3. **Sanding.** We work through progressively finer grits, cutting through old finish and surface damage down to clean bare wood. Edges and corners are done by hand. The goal is a surface that's smooth and consistent across the entire room before any finish goes on.

4. **Stain (if applicable).** If you're changing the color of your floors, stain goes on after sanding. This is also where we color-match repaired or replaced boards so the floor reads as one continuous surface.

5. **Finish coats.** Multiple coats with light sanding between each. Water-based finishes are dry to the touch within a few hours; light foot traffic is typically possible the following day, with full use within a few days.

6. **Cure and care instructions.** The finish continues to harden for several weeks after the final coat. We'll walk you through what to put on the floor, what to keep off it, and how long to wait before rugs go back down.

## Finish Options in a Montana Climate

Most of the country treats finish selection as a purely aesthetic decision. In Montana, it's also practical.

When forced-air heating and wood stoves pull indoor humidity down to 20% or lower through the winter, wood contracts. It expands again in spring. A finish that can't flex with that movement — one that's too brittle or applied too thick — will crack, peel, or haze before its time.

**Water-based finishes** handle this well. They cure to a harder, more flexible film than oil-based options, which means they move with the wood rather than against it. They also dry clearer, so the natural color of white oak or hickory comes through rather than being shifted amber by the finish. Cure times are faster, typically 24 hours before light foot traffic compared to 3–4 days for oil-based — which matters when you're planning around kids, pets, or a Montana winter that doesn't give you a lot of weather windows to work in. Chris specializes in water-based finishes for these reasons.

**Oil-based finishes** add a warm, honeyed tone that some homeowners specifically want — particularly in older Helena homes where the amber warmth suits the character of the house. They're durable, but the strong odor and longer cure time are real tradeoffs in an occupied home. If you're drawn to the look, we'll talk through whether it makes sense for your project.

**Sheen** matters too. High-gloss finish shows every footprint and scratch. A satin or matte sheen is more forgiving in daily life and tends to look more at home in the craftsman houses in Helena's Gulch and in the timber-frame mountain homes up at Big Sky — spaces where the wood should feel lived in, not showroom-polished.

## Keeping Your Refinished Floors in Good Shape

A properly applied finish on sound hardwood should last 7–10 years before it needs another full refinish. What happens between now and then is mostly about maintenance.

Sweep or dust mop regularly. Grit tracked in from outside is what destroys finish over time — it acts like sandpaper underfoot with every pass. A doormat at every exterior door makes a measurable difference, especially during Montana's shoulder seasons when snow and mud come in with every trip through the front door.

Use a hardwood-specific cleaner, not vinegar or general-purpose floor spray. Both can dull a water-based finish over time. When the finish starts to look flat in high-traffic areas — usually after a few years — a buff-and-recoat can restore the sheen without a full sand-down.

Montana winters add one more consideration: dry air. When indoor humidity drops below 30%, you'll often see small gaps open between boards as the wood contracts. This is normal seasonal movement, not a sign that something went wrong. Keeping indoor humidity in the 35–55% range minimizes it. If you heat primarily with a wood stove, a humidifier in the main living area makes a real difference in how your floors look and feel through the winter.
