  - question: "How long does it take to refinish hardwood floors?"
    answer: "Most refinishing projects take 5–7 days depending on the size of the space and the type of finish. Water-based finishes, which we specialize in, cure faster than oil-based options — so you're back on your floors sooner. We'll give you a specific timeline during your estimate based on your square footage and floor condition."

  - question: "How much does hardwood floor installation cost in Helena?"
    answer: "Installation costs vary based on wood species, subfloor conditions, and the complexity of the layout — custom patterns like herringbone or diagonal take more time than a standard straight lay. Rather than quoting a generic per-square-foot range, we prefer to look at your space and give you an honest number based on what's actually involved. Contact us to schedule an estimate — there's no obligation."

  - question: "What type of hardwood is best for Montana's climate?"
    answer: "Montana's dry winters and temperature swings mean your wood choice and acclimation process really matter. White oak is an excellent choice for our climate, and fir — a species native to Montana — also performs well here. Narrower boards tend to be more stable, and engineered products are another great option for handling seasonal movement. We'll also make sure your wood acclimates properly before installation — rushing that step in a dry Montana winter is one of the most common mistakes we see."

  - question: "Should I refinish or replace my old hardwood floors?"
    answer: "In most cases, refinishing is the better option. Even floors that look rough — scratched, discolored, or hidden under old carpet — usually have plenty of life left once they're sanded down to bare wood and refinished. With a variety of natural finishes and a wide range of custom stain options, we can change the entire look of your floor or restore it to like-new condition without replacement. We've restored floors that other contractors said were beyond saving. If replacement truly is the better path, we'll tell you that honestly during the estimate."

  - question: "Can you refinish hardwood floors without sanding?"
    answer: "A maintenance coat — also called a buff-and-recoat — can work if your existing finish is in decent shape and you just want to refresh the sheen. But if you have deep scratches, gouges, stain changes, or worn-through finish, a full sand-and-refinish is what it takes to get real results. We'll assess your floors and let you know which approach makes sense — we won't sell you more work than you need."

  - question: "Do I need to move out while my floors are being refinished?"
    answer: "You don't have to leave your home, but you will need to stay off the floors while we're working and while the finish cures. Water-based finishes have lower odor and faster cure times than oil-based, which makes the process easier to live with. We'll walk you through the timeline and what to expect so you can plan around it."

additional:
  - question: "Can engineered hardwood be refinished?"
    answer: "It depends on the thickness of the wear layer. Engineered hardwood with a wear layer of at least 2mm can typically be sanded and refinished, though usually only once or twice over its lifetime. We'll measure your wear layer during the estimate and let you know what's possible."

  - question: "How often should hardwood floors be refinished?"
    answer: "With proper maintenance, a buff-and-coat (maintenance coat) is typically needed every 5–10 years and is the most cost-effective way to keep your floors looking great. A full sand-and-refinish is usually only needed due to water damage or heavy wear and tear — with regular maintenance coats, that can be 10–25+ years. High-traffic areas like hallways and kitchens may show wear sooner. We provide every homeowner with a wood floor maintenance guide to help you get the most life out of your finish."

  - question: "What's the difference between oil-based and water-based finish?"
    answer: "Oil-based finishes add a warm amber tone, but they have a strong odor and take longer to cure — often 3–4 days before you can walk on the floors. Water-based finishes dry clearer, have lower odor, cure faster, and with recent advances in finish technology are actually more durable than oil-based products. Chris specializes in ceramic-fortified water-based finish — the strongest finish on the market. If you love the warm look of oil-based, we can also apply an oil-based sealer with a water-based top coat to give you that amber tone with superior durability."

  - question: "Can you install hardwood floors over concrete?"
    answer: "Yes. We install hardwood over concrete slabs regularly, including in basements and slab-on-grade homes. All concrete slab installations require a moisture barrier — we use the top-of-the-line Wakol System, which includes a moisture barrier and full trowel glue-down system. If your slab isn't flat and level, we can also apply self-leveling concrete before installation. We'll test your slab and recommend the right approach."

  - question: "How do I maintain my hardwood floors after refinishing?"
    answer: "Regular sweeping or dust mopping is the most important thing — grit is what destroys finish over time. For cleaning, we recommend a hardwood-specific floor cleaner with a microfiber mop, or a simple 10:1 water-to-vinegar solution works well as an alternative. Avoid generic floor cleaners, which can dull the finish. We provide every homeowner with a wood floor maintenance guide tailored to their specific finish, including recommendations for Montana's dry indoor air during winter."

  - question: "Do hardwood floors increase home value?"
    answer: "They do. Real hardwood floors are consistently one of the most valued features by homebuyers, and refinished hardwood can make a significant difference in how a home shows. In Helena and Bozeman's housing markets, quality hardwood floors are an expected feature in well-maintained homes — buyers notice when they're missing."

  - question: "Can you match new hardwood to my existing floors?"
    answer: "In most cases, yes. Matching involves selecting the right species, cut, and width, then custom-staining and finishing to blend with your existing floors. Perfect color matches on day one are difficult because new finish and old finish age differently, but we get as close as possible and the floors will continue to blend over time as they're exposed to the same light and wear."

  - question: "What causes hardwood floors to cup or buckle?"
    answer: "Cupping and buckling are almost always caused by moisture — either from below (a damp crawlspace or slab), from above (spills or leaks), or from humidity imbalances. In Montana, we also see movement from the extreme dryness in winter when homes are heated. Proper acclimation before installation and maintaining consistent indoor humidity are the best prevention."

  - question: "How do I prepare my home for a flooring project?"
    answer: "Clear the rooms of furniture and personal items before we arrive. If you have pets, make a plan to keep them away from the work area. For refinishing projects, remove anything hanging on walls in the work zone since sanding creates fine dust even with our containment setup. We'll cover doorways and vents to minimize dust in the rest of your home."

  - question: "Do you offer free estimates?"
    answer: "We offer free on-site estimates in the Helena area. For Butte, Bozeman, and the rest of western Montana, we ask for a small site visit deposit that gets applied to your project cost. Want a quick ballpark first? Use our estimate request form to send photos and project details and we'll get back to you within 24 hours."

  - question: "What areas do you serve?"
    answer: "We're based in Helena and serve homeowners and builders throughout western Montana, including Butte, Bozeman, Big Sky, Livingston, Paradise Valley, Cascade, and the surrounding communities. If you're not sure whether you're in our service area, give us a call at (406) 451-2282 and we'll let you know."

  - question: "Can you repair water-damaged hardwood floors?"
    answer: "Often, yes. The extent of the damage determines whether we can repair in place or need to replace affected boards. Minor water stains can usually be sanded out during refinishing. More serious damage — warped or buckled boards, blackened wood, or subfloor issues — may require board replacement, but we can typically blend repairs seamlessly with the surrounding floor."

  - question: "What's the best time of year to refinish floors in Montana?"
    answer: "We refinish floors year-round with no issues as long as we have heat in the space. Montana's humidity stays low year-round — slightly drier in winter — so it's not the concern it can be in other climates. For new installations, proper acclimation of the wood is key regardless of the season. Seasonal gaps between boards are normal and usually very minimal with proper installation. Summer tends to be our busiest season, so booking ahead helps."

  - question: "How do wood stoves and dry Montana winters affect hardwood floors?"
    answer: "Dry indoor air causes wood to contract, which can lead to small gaps between boards during winter. This is normal seasonal movement and the gaps typically close back up when humidity returns in spring. Consistent indoor humidity is key — keeping it between 35–55% helps minimize movement. If you heat with a wood stove, a humidifier in the main living area makes a noticeable difference. We also offer in-floor humidity and temperature monitors that install into a floorboard and connect via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, so you can remotely monitor conditions in your floor and subfloor year-round."

  - question: "What's the difference between site-finished and prefinished hardwood?"
    answer: "Prefinished hardwood comes from the factory with its finish already applied — overall project time is faster and there's no dust or odor from finishing on-site. Site-finished hardwood is sanded and finished after installation, which creates a smoother surface with no micro-bevels between boards and allows for fully custom stain colors. We install both, and we'll help you decide which is the better fit based on your project, timeline, and budget."

  - question: "Do you build custom stairs or just refinish existing ones?"
    answer: "Both. We build new hardwood stair treads — including slab-style treads — and we refinish existing staircases. Stairs are one of the most visible features in a home and they take real precision to get right. Whether you're updating a dated staircase or adding hardwood stairs to match new floors, we handle the full scope from fabrication to finish."

  - question: "How do you handle transitions between hardwood and other flooring?"
    answer: "Transitions between hardwood and tile, carpet, or other surfaces need to be clean and intentional. We use custom-milled transition pieces and precision cuts to create seamless boundaries. One of the details we're known for is flush transitions between hardwood and natural stone — no awkward metal strips or raised edges."
